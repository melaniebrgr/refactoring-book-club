# Refactoring Book Club

Excerpt from the preface:

> "...the project failed, in large part because the code was too complex to debug or tune to acceptable performance. The consultant Kent Beck was brought in ... He did several things differently, but one of the most important changes was to insist on continuous cleaning up of the code using refactoring. The improved effectiveness of the team, and the role refactoring played, is what inspired me to write the first edition of this bookâ€”so I could pass on the knowledge that Kent and others have acquired by using refactoring to improve the quality of software."

### Agenda

Every other week we will meet for half and hour at the end of the day to talk about the chapter(s). Each meeting will follow a rough plan: an informal 5-10 recap by a brave attendee, and a [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) discussion of the chapters -- what we found useful, what we found useless, and what was plain confusing. While it's best to read the chapter(s) before the meeting, it's not mandatory, i.e. if you didn't have time to finish the readings you should still come and ask questions. Questions and answers of all levels helps everyone learn, and that's the whole point of this. If you think of something you want to ask or discuss ahead of meeting day, you can jot it down in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1riTzBFDNBvNPHss8z7qK7U1dtx73TgC7yUtzkn3fla8/edit?usp=sharing).
