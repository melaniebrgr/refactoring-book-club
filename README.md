# Refactoring Book Club

### ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.amazon.ca/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28WPJ77S2LZCH&keywords=refactoring+martin+fowler&qid=1552664077&s=gateway&sprefix=refactor%2Caps%2C-1&sr=8-1) (2nd Edition), by Martin Fowler

> "...the project failed, in large part because the code was too complex to debug or tune to acceptable performance. The consultant Kent Beck was brought in ... He did several things differently, but one of the most important changes was to insist on continuous cleaning up of the code using refactoring. The improved effectiveness of the team, and the role refactoring played, is what inspired me to write the first edition of this bookâ€”so I could pass on the knowledge that Kent and others have acquired by using refactoring to improve the quality of software." - Martin Fowler, excerpt from the forward

### Meeting agenda:

We get together every two weeks for 30 min to talk about the chapter(s). Each meeting consists of an informal 5-10 min review then discussion, e.g. [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) style or whatever structure the group prefers. For example, we could discuss what we found helpful, unhelpful, and needed clarifying. As you read chapters, if you think of something you want to ask or discuss ahead of meeting time, you can also jot it down in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1riTzBFDNBvNPHss8z7qK7U1dtx73TgC7yUtzkn3fla8/edit?usp=sharing) to discuss on the day. Finally, while it's to your benefit to read the chapter ahead of time, it's not mandatory and you should aim to come to book club regardless. Questions from all levels of experience helps solidify everyone's learning.
